Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am Youngmin Park, a math and cs major
at University of California, Berkeley. I usually go by the username Bungmint on many websites. This blog
is a project of mine to jot down notes about anything mathematics/CS related (mainly about competitive programming);
Here are some of my profiles on comeptitive programming websites:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Bungmint)
- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/Bungmint)
- [dmoj](https://dmoj.ca/user/Bungmint)

This blog idea is deeply inspired by [smax's blog](https://mzhang2021.github.io/cp-blog/), so check his blog out, too!
Also, this website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the ["Mediumish"](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) theme.
