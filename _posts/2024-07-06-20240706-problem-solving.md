### [BOJ 28427. Tricknology](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/28427)

The condition on the pair $(x, y)$ can be rewritten as $2x + 1$ is prime, so we only need the prefix sum on this predicate, thus, this can be solved in $O(Q + \text{MAX})$.


### [Open Cup 2020/2021 - GP of Suwon. Find the XOR](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/20557)

It is a classic setup using DFS tree + backedges to get all the cycles, and then get the xor basis of the cycles. Then, we see that for every distance $d(i, j)$, it can be decomposed into two parts - $d(i) \oplus d(j)$ which is from traversing the DFS tree, and then some combination of the cycles in the xor basis to get the maximum possible weight. The first part can be computed very efficiently for each query using prefix sum, now for the second part, we first write the xor basis in the RREF, and let it be denoted by $C_1, \ldots, C_k$, with the most significant bits being $2^{i_1}, \ldots, 2^{i_k}$. Since it is in RREF, we know that for each $C_j$, it does not have any of the $2^{i_x}$ for $x \neq j$. This is the main observation. Now, for each $d(i, j)$, $C_x$ is only included if $d(i) \oplus d(j)$ does not have $2^{i_x}$. This lets us use prefix sum (again!) to finish the problem. The time complexity is $O((N + Q)\log\text{MAX})$.
