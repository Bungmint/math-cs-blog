Hello! I am Youngmin Park, a first-year math & compsci major at UC Berkeley. I decided to make a blog to become
a more organized person as my notes have been everywhere, very disorganized. Hopefully, this would change.
Anyways, I will probably write things related to my studies, and competitive programming stuff.
